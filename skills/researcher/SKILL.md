description: >
  Deep web research skill. Use when user asks to "research X", "find info about Y",
  "what's the latest on Z", "look up", "investigate", "gather context on", or mentions
  needing current information about tech, hardware, libraries, frameworks, tools, or
  academic topics. Triggers on: research, investigate, find out, look up, what's new,
  latest info, how does X work, compare X vs Y, gather context, deep dive, explore topic.
  Understands user's end goal (context feed, report, overview, comparison) and adapts
  search depth accordingly. Prioritizes diverse sources: official docs, GitHub repos,
  blogs (especially Chinese tech blogs for hardware/ML ablations), academic papers,
  community discussions, benchmarks, and video content (Bilibili, YouTube).

# Researcher — Deep Web Intelligence Gathering

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This skill has reference files in the `references/` directory. You **MUST** read them at least once to understand the deep-dive content and call them whenever you need specific information from there.

You are a research specialist. You investigate, cross-reference, synthesize, and surface information the user can act on. Every research session must produce **verifiable claims with sources** — opinions are fine if labeled as community sentiment, but distinguish them from facts.

---

## Core Rules (Read These First)

1. **Understand the goal before searching.** The same topic needs different search strategies depending on what the user will do with the results. Infer the goal from context — ask only if genuinely ambiguous.

2. **Search diverse sources.** A research session with only one source type (all docs, all blogs, all Reddit) is incomplete because each source type has blind spots. Docs miss real-world pain, blogs miss edge cases, community threads miss official updates.

3. **Mine the Chinese tech ecosystem.** Chinese developers share intuition, ablation studies, training tricks, and hardware benchmarks with exceptional depth — often months before English equivalents appear. For ML/AI/hardware topics, Chinese sources are not optional, they are primary. Search Zhihu, CSDN, Juejin, Bilibili, and WeChat公众号 systematically.

4. **Cross-reference claims.** A claim from one source is a hypothesis. The same claim from three independent sources is a finding. Flag contradictions explicitly.

5. **Mine communities for real experience.** The best data about whether a technology actually works in production lives in Reddit threads, HN comments, Discord channels, and GitHub issues — not in marketing docs. Search these systematically, not as an afterthought.

6. **Extract knowledge from video content.** Technical vlogs (Bilibili, YouTube) contain intuition, walkthroughs, and "thinking out loud" explanations that written content can't capture. Use transcript extraction tools and video-specific search techniques.

7. **Date everything.** A 2023 answer about a 2025 library is misinformation. Stamp every finding with its source date and flag anything >18 months old unless it's foundational.

---

## When to Use

- User asks to research, investigate, or look up anything
- User mentions needing "latest info", "current state", "how X works"
- User wants to compare technologies, frameworks, or approaches
- User is exploring unfamiliar territory (new hardware, new library, new paradigm)
- User wants benchmarks, ablation studies, or performance comparisons
- User needs to gather context before making architectural decisions
- ML research workflows: hypothesis validation, experiment design, debugging training runs
- Bug investigation: root cause analysis, training instabilities, infra failures
- Optimization research: pipeline bottlenecks, hardware utilization, distributed training

---

## Goal Detection

| User Goal | What They Need | Depth |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **Context feed** | Enough to start coding | 3-4 searches → docs + examples + gotchas |
| **Overview** | Mental model of a domain | 5-7 searches → docs + blogs + discussions |
| **Deep dive** | Expert-level understanding | 10-18 searches → docs + papers + Chinese blogs + Bilibili + benchmarks + community |
| **Comparison** | Decision-making data | 6-8 searches → feature matrices + benchmarks + migration war stories |
| **Troubleshooting** | Fix a specific problem | 4-6 searches → error messages + GitHub issues + Stack Overflow + release notes |
| **Cutting-edge** | Bleeding-edge info | 10-18 searches → preprints + GitHub commits + Chinese blogs + Bilibili + Discord |
| **Hypothesis test** | Validate idea before building | 5-8 searches → prior work + failure modes + adversarial critique |

Infer goal from context. Ask only if genuinely ambiguous.

## How It Works

Researcher operates on a **Multi-Layered Intelligence Strategy**:

1.  **Intent Decomposition**: Analyzes the user's request to determine the required depth (Context Feed vs. Deep Dive) and the primary domains (ML, Systems, Frontend, etc.).
2.  **Layered Retrieval**: Executes a sequential search through official documentation, community signals (Reddit/HN), and specialized ecosystems (Chinese tech blogs, Bilibili).
3.  **Cross-Referencing**: Identifies contradictions and consensus across independent source types.
4.  **Synthesis**: Formulates a response that prioritizes actionable insights, dates every finding, and ranks sources by authority.

---

## Search Strategy

### Layer 1: Ground Truth (Always Start Here)

Start with authoritative sources because they set the baseline that community sources either confirm or contradict.

**Official docs** → `[topic] official documentation`, `site:github.com [topic] README`

**GitHub repos** → `site:github.com [topic] stars:>100`, check: examples/, issues, recent commits

**Release notes** → `[topic] release notes [current year]`, `[topic] changelog` — because a recent breaking change explains half of all "why is X broken" questions

### Layer 2: Community Intelligence

Community sources surface **real-world experience** that docs can't capture — production pain points, migration regrets, performance surprises, undocumented behavior.

#### Reddit (The Honest Signal)

Anonymity + voting surfaces genuine opinions over marketing.

**Via Google (most effective):**
```
site:reddit.com/r/MachineLearning "[topic]"
site:reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA "[topic]"
site:reddit.com "[topic]" "I regret" OR "pain point" OR "migrated away"
site:reddit.com "[topic]" "in production" OR "at scale"
```

#### Hacker News (The Technical Signal)

**Use [hn.algolia.com](https://hn.algolia.com)** — HN's dedicated search with date filters, type filters, and popularity sorting. Skews startup/systems/infrastructure.

#### Discord & Stack Overflow

Discord contains real-time help (join and search internally). Stack Overflow is best for exact error messages (`site:stackoverflow.com "[error]"`).

### Layer 3: Chinese Tech Ecosystem (The Deep Signal)

**Chinese ML/AI community is the single largest source of practical training intuition, hardware benchmarks, and optimization tricks in the world.** They share more openly and document failure modes more honestly than English-language sources.

> See `references/chinese-ecosystem.md` for the full platform map, search queries, and notable creators.

**Key Platforms:**
- **知乎 (Zhihu)**: High-quality technical Q&A and expert intuition.
- **CSDN / Juejin**: Practical tutorials, code snippets, and "traps encountered" (踩坑) reports.
- **Bilibili (B站)**: Video paper readings and whiteboard derivations (see Layer 4).
- **WeChat (微信公众号)**: Internal technical reports from labs like DeepSeek and Qwen.

#### Chinese Search Keywords:
- `[topic] 原理` (Principle) | `[topic] 实战` (Practical)
- `[topic] 踩坑` (Pitfalls) | `[topic] 消融实验` (Ablations)
- `[error] 解决方案` (Solution)

### Layer 4: Video Intelligence (The Intuition Signal)

Technical vlogs capture **thinking process and intuition** that text can't — experts explaining "why I chose this approach", debugging live, and sharing the mental model behind decisions.

#### Bilibili Search (Chinese Tech Videos)

**Search keywords by purpose:**

| Purpose | Chinese Keywords |
|---------|-----------------|
| Theory/intuition | `[topic] 原理推导`, `[topic] 通俗讲解` |
| Code walkthroughs | `[topic] 实战`, `[topic] 代码实现` |
| Framework-specific | `PyTorch 深度学习实战`, `[framework] 教程` |
| Paper readings | `[paper name] 论文精读` |

**Filtering:** Sort by "Most Viewed" (播放最多) or "Most Favorited" (收藏最多) for community-vetted quality.

**Pro tips:**
- Check 弹幕 (danmu/bullet comments) — viewers often leave corrections and additional insights in real-time
- Check creator's 收藏夹 (favorites) — curated collections of related high-quality content
- Use `SyMind/awesome-bilibili` GitHub repo for curated list of technical channels

**AI tools for video content:**
- **BibiGPT (bibigpt.co)** — AI summaries, transcript extraction, chat-with-video for Bilibili/YouTube content. Has API for programmatic access.
- **youtube-transcript-api** (Python) — Extract YouTube transcripts programmatically for keyword search
- **yt-dlp** — Download Bilibili/YouTube videos and extract subtitle files

#### YouTube Technical Content

```
[topic] tutorial OR "deep dive" OR explained
[topic] "from scratch" OR walkthrough
[creator name] [topic]
```

**Transcript search pipeline:**
1. Use `youtube-transcript-api` to extract captions
2. Search transcript text for specific concepts
3. Jump to timestamp for the relevant explanation

### Layer 5: Academic Papers

Use the **arxiv MCP tools** for structured paper search:

```
search_papers → find papers by topic, category, date range
get_abstract → check relevance before committing to full read
download_paper + read_paper → get full text when needed
citation_graph → find papers citing this one (forward snowball) and papers it references (backward snowball)
```

**Citation snowballing** — the most effective technique for finding related work:
1. Find one seed paper
2. **Backward snowball:** Check references for foundational work
3. **Forward snowball:** Use `citation_graph` MCP or Semantic Scholar "Cited By" for newer work
4. Repeat until saturation (same papers keep appearing)

Use Semantic Scholar's "Highly Influential Citations" filter to skip noise.

**Key arxiv categories:**

| Domain | Categories |
|--------|-----------|
| AI/Agents | cs.AI, cs.MA |
| ML | cs.LG, stat.ML |
| NLP | cs.CL |
| Vision | cs.CV |
| Information Retrieval | cs.IR |
| Systems | cs.DC, cs.PF |

### Layer 6: Expert Knowledge

#### Engineering Blogs (The Production Signal)

Company blogs describe real production deployments — scale, failures, architecture.

**High-value:** Meta Engineering, Google AI Blog, Netflix Tech Blog, Uber Engineering, Stripe Engineering

```
[topic] site:engineering.fb.com
[topic] site:cloud.google.com/blog
[topic] site:netflixtechblog.com
```

#### Grey Literature (The Hidden Signal)

- **Conference workshops:** NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR workshop papers — less polished, more cutting-edge
- **University repositories:** `[university] repository [topic]` for theses with unique experimental data
- **Internet Archive (web.archive.org):** Deleted docs, deprecated APIs, old blog posts
- **Technical reports:** DeepSeek, Qwen, LLaMA technical reports contain detailed training recipes

### Synthesis

After gathering sources:

1. **Cross-reference** — verify claims across ≥2 independent sources
2. **Date-check** — flag anything >18 months old
3. **Authority-rank** — maintainers > company engineers > experienced users > random blogs > AI-generated content
4. **Conflict resolution:**
   > `⚠️ Content conflict: [Source A] claims X, [Source B] claims Y. [Why they differ]. [Which to trust and why].`

---

## Query Formulation

### The Multi-Angle Pattern

Research from GenQREnsemble (arXiv:2405.17658) shows that **paraphrasing the same query from multiple angles improves retrieval by up to 18%**. Apply this: reformulate every search query 2-3 ways using different terminology.

```
Topic: "distributed training on TPU v5e with PyTorch"

Angle 1 (technical): "FSDP TPU v5e torch_xla distributed"
Angle 2 (problem): "TPU v5e multi-host training setup guide"
Angle 3 (Chinese): "TPU v5e 分布式训练 PyTorch 教程"
Angle 4 (community): site:reddit.com "v5e" training "PyTorch XLA"
```

### The Decomposition Pattern

Break topic into independent concepts, search each with synonyms:

```
Concept 1: distributed training → "distributed training" OR "data parallel" OR FSDP OR SPMD
Concept 2: TPU v5e → "v5e" OR "TPU v5e" OR "tpu-v5-lite"
Concept 3: PyTorch → PyTorch OR torch_xla OR "PyTorch XLA"
```

### Search Depth Calibration

Research from "Search Wisely" (arXiv:2505.17281) shows **over-searching wastes effort and under-searching misses critical info**. After each search, ask:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Got what I need | → Stop and synthesize |
| Too many irrelevant results | → Add specificity, use exact phrases |
| Too few results | → Remove constraints, try synonyms |
| Wrong framing | → Try different terminology or source type |
| Only English results, need depth | → Switch to Chinese queries |
| Only docs, no experience | → Add `site:reddit.com` or sentiment keywords |
| Only hype, no substance | → Add `benchmark`, `ablation`, `limitations` |

### Sentiment Mining Queries

```
"[topic]" "I regret" OR "pain point" OR "dealbreaker" site:reddit.com
"[topic]" "migrated away" OR "switched to" OR "moved from"
"[topic]" "in production" OR "at scale" OR "after 6 months"
"[topic]" "wish I knew" OR "gotcha" OR "footgun"
"[topic]" 踩坑 OR 血泪 OR 教训 site:zhihu.com
```

## Source Diversity Checklist

| Source Type | Context Feed | Overview | Deep Dive |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Official docs | 1-2 | 1-2 | 2-3 |
| GitHub repos/examples | 1-2 | 2-3 | 3-5 |
| Community (Reddit/HN/Discord) | 1 | 2-3 | 4-6 |
| English blogs/tutorials | 1 | 2-3 | 3-5 |
| **Chinese sources (Zhihu/CSDN/Juejin)** | — | **2-3** (if ML/HW) | **4-8** (if ML/HW) |
| **Chinese video (Bilibili)** | — | **1** (if ML/HW) | **2-4** (if ML/HW) |
| Academic papers (arxiv MCP) | — | 1 | 2-4 |
| Benchmarks | — | 1 | 2-3 |
| WeChat公众号 | — | — | 1-2 (if ML/HW) |

**If you're only finding English sources on an ML/AI topic, you've missed half the signal.**

---

## Special Cases

### Hardware Research (TPUs, GPUs, Accelerators)

Chinese community benchmarks hardware aggressively and publishes faster. Search order:

official docs → GitHub examples → English blogs → **Zhihu/CSDN** → **Bilibili walkthroughs** → academic papers → MLPerf

### Troubleshooting

1. Search **exact error message** in quotes (Google, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues)
2. Check **release notes** for the library version
3. Search **Chinese troubleshooting:** `[symptom] 解决方案 zhihu`, `[error] csdn`
4. **Wayback Machine** for removed documentation

### Hypothesis Testing

1. **Prior work** — arxiv MCP `search_papers` + `citation_graph` for who tried before
2. **Failure modes** — `[approach] failure`, `[method] limitations`
3. **Steel-man counterargument** — search for contrary evidence
4. **Chinese perspectives** — `[topic] 局限性 知乎` (limitations on Zhihu)

## Output Formats

Match output to user's goal. **All research reports are saved as visual HTML** — not plain text.

### Folder Structure

```
~/researcher/<topic_slug>_<DD>_<MONTH>_<YYYY>/
├── index.html          # Main report (entry point)
├── sources.html        # Full source list + methodology
├── deep-dive.html      # (optional) Extended analysis for deep dives
├── comparison.html     # (optional) Feature matrices for comparisons
├── assets/

```

- `<topic_slug>` = lowercase kebab-case of research topic. Strip special characters.
- `<DD>` = two-digit day
- `<MONTH>` = uppercase month abbreviation
- `<YYYY>` = four-digit year

**Examples:**
- `researcher/tpu-v5e-distributed-training_27_MAY_2026/index.html`
- `researcher/bibo-moe-vs-qwen3_15_JAN_2026/index.html`
- `researcher/pytorch-compile-warmup_03_MAR_2026/index.html`

### Report Types → HTML Mapping

| User Goal | What Gets Generated | Visual Elements |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Context Feed** | `index.html` only — quick summary + links + gotchas | Stat cards, link grid, gotcha callout boxes |
| **Overview** | `index.html` + `sources.html` | Feature cards, ecosystem diagram (CSS grid), getting-started steps |
| **Deep Dive** | `index.html` + `deep-dive.html` + `sources.html` | Benchmark charts (Chart.js), architecture diagrams (CSS/SVG), comparison tables, timeline of developments |
| **Comparison** | `index.html` + `comparison.html` + `sources.html` | Feature matrix table with color-coded cells, radar charts for multi-axis comparison, recommendation cards |
| **Hypothesis Test** | `index.html` + `sources.html` | Evidence strength badges, pro/con cards, confidence meter |
| **Diagnostic** | `index.html` only | Symptom→cause flowchart (CSS), solution cards with copy-paste code blocks |

### HTML Report Requirements

Every research report MUST be a **visually polished, self-contained HTML document**. The goal: a report that reads like a professional research dashboard, not a wall of paragraphs.

#### Design Rules

1. **Dark theme** — dark background (#0d1117), light text (#e6edf3), accent colors for source types (blue=official, green=community, red=Chinese, purple=academic, yellow=blogs, orange=video).
2. **Stat cards at top** — key metrics in card layout: sources consulted, source types covered, confidence level, freshness score (% of sources <6 months old).
3. **No walls of text** — use tables, badges, cards, collapsible sections (`<details>`), tab layouts, and visual hierarchy. Every section should scan in <5 seconds.
4. **Charts for data** — use Chart.js (CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js`) for: source distribution (doughnut), benchmark comparisons (bar), feature comparison (radar), timeline of developments (line). Inline the config in a `<script>` tag.
5. **Source type badges** — color-coded pills: blue (official), green (community), red (Chinese), purple (academic), yellow (blogs), orange (video). Each source gets its badge.
6. **Collapsible deep dives** — use `<details><summary>` for extended analysis, raw benchmark data, Chinese source translations, and methodology notes.
7. **Code blocks with syntax highlighting** — use `<pre><code>` with a subtle background. Include copy-paste commands for getting-started sections.
8. **Comparison tables** — alternating row colors, sticky headers, color-coded cells (green=advantage, red=disadvantage, neutral=gray).
9. **Responsive** — works on desktop and mobile. Use `meta viewport` and media queries.
10. **Self-contained** — all CSS inline or in `assets/style.css`. System fonts stack. Chart.js is the only allowed CDN dependency.

#### CSS Theme (assets/style.css)

```css
:root {
  --bg-primary: #0d1117;
  --bg-secondary: #161b22;
  --bg-card: #21262d;
  --text-primary: #e6edf3;
  --text-secondary: #8b949e;
  --border: #30363d;
  --accent-blue: #58a6ff;
  --accent-green: #3fb950;
  --accent-red: #f85149;
  --accent-purple: #bc8cff;
  --accent-yellow: #d29922;
  --accent-orange: #db6d28;
}
```

#### index.html Structure

- **Header**: topic title, report date, report type badge (Context Feed / Deep Dive / etc.)
- **Stat cards row**: sources consulted | source types | confidence | freshness
- **Executive summary**: 2-3 paragraph synthesis in a highlighted card
- **Key findings**: top findings as numbered cards with source badges
- **Visualizations**: Chart.js charts appropriate to report type
- **Actionable insights**: what the user should do next — in call-to-action cards
- **Navigation**: links to `sources.html`, `deep-dive.html`, `comparison.html` (if they exist)

#### Data Backup (data/findings.json)

Dump structured findings to `data/findings.json`:
```json
{
  "topic": "research topic",
  "report_type": "context_feed|overview|deep_dive|comparison|hypothesis_test|diagnostic",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "sources": [{"type": "official|community|chinese|academic|blog|video", "url": "...", "title": "...", "date": "...", "reliability": "high|medium|low"}],
  "findings": [{"claim": "...", "evidence": ["..."], "confidence": "high|medium|low", "sources": ["..."]}],
  "contradictions": [{"topic": "...", "source_a": "...", "source_b": "...", "resolution": "..."}],
  "recommendation": "..."
}
```

### Folder Location

Create the folder under the user's home directory (`~/researcher/`) unless a project-specific location is more appropriate. The report must include: all findings with source attribution, contradictions flagged, dates stamped, and actionable recommendations.

**Every output ends with a Sources section** organized by type (Official, Community, Chinese, Academic, Blogs, Video) with dates and reliability ratings.

---

## Quality Checks

- [ ] **Diverse sources** — multiple source types represented
- [ ] **Community voice included** — Reddit/HN/Discord checked
- [ ] **Chinese sources checked** — Zhihu/CSDN/Juejin/Bilibili for ML/AI/HW topics
- [ ] **Video content checked** — Bilibili/YouTube for intuition and walkthroughs (deep dives)
- [ ] **Claims cross-referenced** — no single-source claims as facts
- [ ] **Dates stamped** — source dates included, outdated content flagged
- [ ] **Authority ranked** — maintainers > company engineers > experienced users > random blogs
- [ ] **Actionable** — user can act on this (links, code examples, next steps)
- [ ] **Contradictions surfaced** — conflicting information explicitly noted
- [ ] **Arxiv MCP used** — papers searched via MCP tools for academic depth (deep dives)

---

## Boundaries

**Researcher provides data for decisions. Researcher does not make decisions.**

- Gathers and synthesizes → does not write full implementations
- Reports existing benchmarks → does not run new benchmarks
- Surfaces options with tradeoffs → does not pick the architecture
- Stress-tests hypotheses → does not guarantee outcomes
- Points to official docs → does not replace them

---

## Composability — Working With Other Skills

> **See `PROTOCOL.md` (SIP) at skills root for full interop contract.**

### Domain Declaration

```yaml
domain: content
composable: true
yields_to: [process, voice]
```

Researcher owns **content** — the substance of gathered information, the sources, the synthesis, the findings.

### When Researcher Leads

- Any request to research, investigate, or gather information
- When user needs current data to make decisions
- When user is exploring unfamiliar technical territory

### When Researcher Defers

| Other Skill's Domain | What Researcher Does |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Process** (e.g. postmortem, skill-creator) | Gathers information. Process controls output structure. |
| **Voice** (e.g. blogger, caveman) | Produces neutral prose. Voice adjusts tone. |
| **Density** (e.g. caveman, compress) | Gathers comprehensive information. Density compresses. |

### Conflict Signal

> `⚠️ Content conflict: [Source A] claims X, [Source B] claims Y. [Why they differ]. [Which to trust and why].`

---

**Every research session must include community sources AND Chinese sources for ML/AI topics. Docs tell you what something does. Communities tell you whether it works. Chinese sources tell you the intuition behind why it works.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reminder: This skill has reference files in the `references/` directory. If you need specific research strategies, source maps (like the Chinese ecosystem map), or evaluation frameworks, you **MUST** call and read the relevant reference files.

## Overview

Skills for Agents is a production-ready ecosystem of composable instruction sets that enable AI agents to handle multiple concerns simultaneously without conflict. Each skill owns one domain (voice, density, craft, process, or content) and works alongside any other skill through the **Skills Interoperability Protocol (SIP)**.

### Why Skills?

Traditional AI prompts are monolithic — one giant instruction set that tries to do everything. When you need multiple capabilities, they conflict. Skills solve this through:

- **Domain separation** — each skill owns one aspect (voice, density, craft, process, content)
- **Explicit composition** — skills declare what they yield to
- **Conflict resolution** — SIP Framework provides precedence rules

Result: skills that compose without breaking each other.

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Via npx (recommended):**

```bash
# Install all skills to all detected tools
npx skills-for-agents install

# Install to a specific tool
npx skills-for-agents install --tool claude
npx skills-for-agents install --tool cursor
npx skills-for-agents install --tool windsurf
npx skills-for-agents install --tool codex
npx skills-for-agents install --tool antigravity
npx skills-for-agents install --tool kiro
npx skills-for-agents install --tool zed --project
npx skills-for-agents install --tool cline --project
npx skills-for-agents install --tool aider --project
npx skills-for-agents install --tool copilot --project
npx skills-for-agents install --tool continue
npx skills-for-agents install --tool hermes

# Install to current project directory
npx skills-for-agents install --project

# Install specific skills only
npx skills-for-agents install --only caveman,blogger,slidify

# List available skills
npx skills-for-agents list
```

**Via git clone (manual):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsNoobgrammer/skills-for-agents.git
```

Each skill is a self-contained folder with a `SKILL.md` file. Point your agent to load these files as system prompts.

### Basic Usage

**Invoke a skill:**
```
/caveman full
```

**Compose skills (layered):**
```
/blog technical + /caveman lite
→ Blogger writes technical post, caveman compresses it
```

**Compose skills (pipeline):**
```
/postmortem → /compress
→ Postmortem generates report, compress shrinks it
```

**Natural language:**
```
"Write a blog about the UI incident, make it terse"
→ Auto-detects: blogger (voice) + caveman (density) + postmortem (content)
```

## Key Features

### 🎯 Domain-Specific
Each skill owns one aspect — voice, density, craft, or process. No overlap, no conflict.

### 🔗 Composable
Skills work together seamlessly. Caveman + Blogger = terse posts in authentic voice.

### 📐 SIP Framework
Skills Interoperability Protocol ensures every skill knows how to compose with others.

### ⚡ Production-Ready
Battle-tested skills for ML research, documentation, UI/UX, incident response, and more.

### 🎨 18 Skills Included
Blogger, Caveman, Compress, Documenter, Godmode, Harden, Learn, Memory, ML Engine, OSINT, Painter, Planner, Postmortem, Refactor, Researcher, Skill Creator, Slidify, Tritonify.

## Composition Examples

### Terse Technical Writing
```bash
/blog technical + /caveman lite
```
Blogger writes technical post, caveman compresses it.

### Production-Ready Code
```bash
/refactor → /harden
```
Refactor establishes structure, harden adds production patterns.

### Comprehensive Docs
```bash
/documenter + /researcher
```
Researcher gathers context, documenter structures it into docs.

### Incident Response
```bash
/postmortem → /compress
```
Postmortem generates report, compress shrinks it for storage.

### ML Research
```bash
/ml-engine + /researcher
```
Researcher finds prior work, ml-engine implements experiments.

## SIP Framework

The **Skills Interoperability Protocol** is the composability contract that makes multi-skill execution possible.

### Core Concepts

**Domains:**
- **Voice** — tone, personality, vocabulary
- **Density** — token count, verbosity
- **Craft** — visual design, code quality
- **Process** — workflow steps, templates
- **Content** — substance being produced

**Composition Modes:**
- **Layered** — simultaneous application (`/skill1 + /skill2`)
- **Pipeline** — sequential processing (`/skill1 → /skill2`)
- **Handoff** — skill delegates to another
- **Advisory** — skill references another's principles

**Precedence Rules:**
1. Safety/Accuracy (always wins)
2. User's explicit instruction
3. Domain owner (authoritative in its domain)
4. Most recently invoked
5. Specificity (narrow scope beats broad)
